/*
 * HMMNode.cpp
 *
 *	This is the cpp file for the HMMNode object. The HMMNode represents a node
 *  in a hidden markov model.  Mostly it is a place holder for information
 *  pertaining to a particular state at a position in the HMM.
 *
 *  Important Attributes:
 *		id - position in the HMM
 *		state - the underlying state this node represents in the HMM
 *		residue - the residue in this position in the sequence used to build the HMM
 *		inTransitions - HMMTransitions that are coming into this node from the previous
 *						position in the HMM
 *		outTransitions - HMMTransitions that are leaving this node to the next position
 *						 in the HMM
 *		highestWeight - the highest weight determined by the viterbi path
 *		higheestWeightPreviousNode - the previous node in the HMM that gave the highest
 *									 weight viterbi path
